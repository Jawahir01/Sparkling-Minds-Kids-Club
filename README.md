- # The-Surface-Plane

  - ## Design
  - ### Colour-Scheme
      ![Thank-you-page](static/img/Doc/colors.png)
  - ### Typography

    - The fonts for the website were imported using Google Fonts.
    - The main font is â€˜Heeboâ€™ as a clear, legible font suitable for body text. and â€˜San Serifâ€™ as a fallback font for the text on screens of all sizes.
    - The Headings are â€˜cursiveâ€™ to add a playful and whimsical touch to the website, and â€˜Lobster Twoâ€™ as a fallback font for the text on screens of all sizes.
  	In fact, by combining the features of both fonts and design principles, The Sparkling Clubs Website can effectively capture the attention and imagination of its young audience while providing an enjoyable and informative online experience.
