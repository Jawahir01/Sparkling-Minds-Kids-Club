            I want parents and kids to have a blast using the app! I envision an experience where families can easily check out all the cool activities and courses we offer. Parents should feel informed, and kids should be super excited to join in. My goal is to make the app easy to use, fun to explore, and full of awesome opportunities for learning and growth.

            1.	I need to create the navbar so that users can navigate the website from any device.
            2.	I need to create the base.html page and structure so that other pages can reuse the layout.
            3.	I need to create static resources so that images, css and javascript work on the website.
            4.	I need to set up the project so that it is ready for implementing the core features.

  - ### Database Design


  - ### Security

- ## The-Surface-Plane

  - ### Design
  ??
  - ### Colour-Scheme
    
  - ### Typography
    - The fonts for the website were imported using Google Fonts.
    -	The main font is ‘Heebo’ as a clear, legible font suitable for body text. and ‘San Serif’ as a fallback font for the text on screens of all sizes.
    -	The Headings are ‘cursive’ to add a playful and whimsical touch to the website, and ‘Lobster Two’ as a fallback font for the text on screens of all sizes.

  In fact, by combining the features of both fonts and design principles, The Sparkling Clubs Website can effectively capture the attention and imagination of its young audience while providing an enjoyable and informative online experience.
